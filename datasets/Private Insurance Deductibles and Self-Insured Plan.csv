"Notes"
"Averages for employer-sponsored plan deductibles are for private-sector employees."
""
"All averages for marketplace deductibles are weighted by 2020 plan selections. This table includes plans with a $0 deductible. Plans with separate drug and medical deductibles are excluded."
""
"Under self-insured plans, employers assume financial responsibility for providing health benefits to their employees by paying health claims directly instead of contracting with an insurance company to cover those costs. Employers that self insure may contract with an insurance company to serve as a third party administrator for plan administration.  "

"The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) Insurance Component is an annual survey of establishments that collects information about employer-sponsored health insurance offerings in the United States. Definitions and descriptions of the methods used for this survey can be found in the [Technical Appendix](http://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/survey_comp/ic_technical_notes.shtml)."
