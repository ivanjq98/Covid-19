"Notes"
"Deaths are age-adjusted to the total U.S. population in 2000. Since death rates are affected by the population composition of a given area, age-adjusted death rates should be used for comparisons between areas because they control for differences in population composition. Data may not sum to total due to rounding."
""
"Causes of death attributable to flu and pneumonia include ICD-10 Codes J09-J18. Causes of death attributable to influenza specifically include ICD-10 codes J09, J10.0, J10.1, J10.8, J11.0, J11.1, and J11.8. Causes of death attributable to pneumonia specifically include ICD-10 codes J12.0, J12.1, J12.2, J12.3, J12.8, J12.9, J13, J14, J15.0, J15.1, J15.2, J15.3, J15.4, J15.5, J15.6, J15.7, J15.8, J15.9, J16.0, J16.8, J18.0, J18.1, J18.2, J18.8, and J18.9."

"Pneumonia vaccination data represent adults who reported receiving a pneumonia vaccine within the past year. Data based on the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, an ongoing, state-based, random-digit-dialed telephone survey of non-institutionalized civilian adults aged 18 years and older.
